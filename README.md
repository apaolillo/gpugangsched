iiiiiiiThis repository contains all the code written for my bachelor's thesis.

The directories "busyKernel", "cudaCourse" and "matrixAdd" contain experiments that partition the TPCs on an NVIDIA GPU. 
Running these experiments can be done by executing the shell file in these directories:
```bash
./execute.sh
```
